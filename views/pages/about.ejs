  <h2>Profile</h2>
  <p>About a year ago, a bit bored with my current line of work, I desperately began searching for something new. I had been in the service industry for seventeen years and had reached a plateau in job related growth. Tech had always interested me, but, being a part of the Humanities (I majored in theater), it seemed a strange and foreign world. Through various website tutorials, I dabbled in coding and realized that the very nature of coding is language. This opened up my eyes, serving as a bridge between my Humanities background and my desire to enter the Technology sphere. Eventually, my dabbling would lead me to Actualize coding bootcamp. I greatly enjoyed the experience and look forward to a much needed change in my career.</p>
